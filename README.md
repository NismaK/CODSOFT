# CODSOFT
CodSoft Machine Learning Internship | July - August 2024 During my internship at CodSoft, I focused on enhancing my skills in Machine Learning, working on real-world projects that involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model development. 
# CodSoft Machine Learning Internship - Task Repository
This repository contains the projects completed during my Machine Learning Internship at CodSoft. The internship focused on practical applications of machine learning techniques, and I worked on three main tasks:

<b>1.Customer Churn Prediction</b><br>
<b>2.Credit Card Fraud Detection</b><br>
<b>3.Spam SMS Detection</b><br>

# Project Overview
<b>1. Customer Churn Prediction </b>
Objective: To build a predictive model that identifies customers who are likely to cancel their subscription to a service or product.
Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Approach:
Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, performed feature scaling, and encoded categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed trends and patterns to identify key indicators of churn.
Model Development: Tested several classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to determine the best-performing model.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC scores.
<b>2. Credit Card Fraud Detection</b>
Objective: To detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a machine learning model.
Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)
Approach:
Data Preprocessing: Managed imbalanced data by using SMOTE, normalized the data, and selected relevant features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigated the distribution of fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.
Model Development: Implemented classification models such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
Model Evaluation: Assessed the models based on confusion matrix, F1-score, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
<b>3. Spam SMS Detection </b>
Objective: To classify SMS messages as spam or ham (not spam) using natural language processing techniques.
Tech Stack: Python, NLTK, Scikit-learn, Pandas
Approach:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and tokenized the text data, removed stop words, and applied TF-IDF for feature extraction.
Model Development: Employed models like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
